Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296

Problem 3:

a) Because gc_count was not initialized before the for loop, it doesn't have any value inside the loop
and python cannot add +1 to something that isn't a number.

b) Because nucleotides was not defined, there are no values for the for loop to loop through. Defining
nucleotides connects the for loop to the nucleotidee values in the file.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.4302926296296296
AT-content: 0.5689938518518518

Problem 5:

G-content: 0.21254714814814815
C-content: 0.21774548148148148
A-content: 0.2852328518518519
T-content: 0.283761

Problem 6:

In every sample, the sum of G+C+A+T counts are different from the total count and the length of nucleotides
but the total count and length of nucleotides are equal to each other in every sample. This is because
in the data, some of the nucleotides are not G,C,A, or T. There are some other letters such as N or B.
The GC content should be computed with the sum of G+C+A+T counts in the denominator instead of total_count, 
since it represents ONLY the number of GCAT nucleotides, without the other letters.
I changed my code accordingly.
