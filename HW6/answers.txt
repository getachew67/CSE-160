Answer to Problem 7:

Iranian 2009 election MSE: 0.000739583333333
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the Iranian 2009 election MSE: 383
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the Iranian 2009 election MSE: 9617
Iranian 2009 election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.9617

My output shows that 9617 of the MSEs were smaller than the 2009 Iranian election MSE
and 383 were larger or equal. This means that only 3.83% of genuine elections would
be as different from the uniform distribution as the Iranian election was.
It is highly unlikely that the Iranian election was genuine. 
The 2009 Iranaian election null hypothesis rejection p-value is 0.9617, which is 
more than the 0.05 threshold. We fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
the election is not fraudulent.

Answer to Problem 8:

2008 United States election MSE: 0.0001410025876058068
United States 2008 election MSE: 0.0001410025876058068
Quantity of MSEs larger than or equal to the United States 2008 election MSE: 4850
Quantity of MSEs smaller than the United States 2008 election MSE: 5150
United States 2008 election null hypothesis rejection level p: 0.515

We fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value (0.515) is greater than
the threshold 0.05. We conclude that the election was not fraudulent.
